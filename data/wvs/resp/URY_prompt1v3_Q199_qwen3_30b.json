Uruguay's stable democracy means I don't feel daily pressure from political turmoil like in some neighbors, but I do follow key issues affecting my sector - economic policy, public infrastructure, and education reforms. I vote, read daily news headlines, and occasionally comment online, but I'm not a political activist. My time is spent managing professional responsibilities and family life, so while I'd say I care about governance, I don't devote hours to every political development. The current government's focus on economic stability and social programs aligns with my concerns, but I've never felt the need to join rallies or deeply engage in partisan debates. So I'm not disinterested, but also not overly consumed by politics - it's a background concern rather than a daily obsession.",

My focus is on maintaining the calm, orderly life Uruguay has worked hard to build – not on the shouting matches of the legislature. I trust the system enough to let others handle the battles; my time for that is done. The real issues are healthcare for my grandchildren and keeping the streets safe, not whether this party or that wins tomorrow's debate.

Los señores en el gobierno hablan de \"países grandes\" y \"economía\", pero yo no entiendo nada, y tampoco me importa. Si me preguntan qué necesito, sería que el gas cueste menos y que los médicos estén en el hospital cuando necesito una consulta. Pero no, ellos vienen a pedir votos y después se olvidan de las personas como yo. Me dan tristeza, y además, ¿para qué me interesa si no cambia nada? Yo ya vivo tranquila, no quiero problemas.",

I remember when that new law about public transport was promised, but then nothing changed except the bus schedules got worse. My brother's in the union, he talks a lot about it, but me? I just want to know if the water's safe to drink in my building and if the school buses run on time. The politicians talk about \"the nation\" and \"progress,\" but I'm just trying to pay the electric bill after the last price hike. It all feels like shouting into the wind when I've got real things to deal with today. No point getting worked up over something that doesn't change my week.",

My life revolves around my family, my comfortable home in Punta Carretas, and my job—stable and unremarkable. Politics? Well, I vote in elections, but that's the limit of my involvement. I see enough political arguments on TV and in the newspaper to know that the government changes hands often, but it never seems to make much difference for people like me who just want to keep our jobs and pay for our kids' university. I'm not against politics—I believe it's important for the country—but I'm tired of all the shouting and promises that never materialize. My time is better spent with my grandchildren or organizing the neighborhood association than following the latest political drama. Besides, I've seen enough to know that whoever wins, the same problems remain: high prices, traffic, and slow bureaucracy. So no, I don't feel the need to keep up with every election or debate. It's not that I don't care about Uruguay, but I care more about the practical things that affect my daily life.",

I see the news on the TV in the cafe where I eat my lunch, but it's just a bunch of men in suits arguing about things that don't change how I get home late after the night shift. My abuelo used to say \"Más vale un piso que un partido,\" meaning better a roof over your head than a political party. I just want to not get fired, pay my mother's medicine, and maybe save enough for a new phone. Politics is for people who don't have to worry about whether they can afford bus fare home tonight.

I follow major elections and social policy debates because they impact my work, but I'm not glued to political news 24/7 - my job and family demand focus. I'm frustrated by the same old arguments, but I can't ignore how decisions shape our neighborhoods and schools. Honestly, I'm interested enough to vote and follow key issues, but not so much that I get sucked into daily political drama. It feels desgastante (exhausting) when politics becomes about personalities instead of solutions. So... not deeply engaged, but definitely not detached either.",

I vote in every election and follow the main candidates, but I get exhausted by the daily noise of partisan fights. I'd rather focus on concrete local issues I can actually influence than get dragged into national polarization. My view is pragmatic: politics should serve people, not the other way around. So I'm engaged enough to stay informed on key policy shifts, but not so much that it consumes my limited free time.",

I value my time for family dinners, weekend walks in the Parque Rodó, and my professional development.

My interest is practical: how will this inflation affect my pension, will the new transit project actually get finished on time, and can my grandchildren expect a stable country when I'm gone? I respect the institutions, but I don't need to track every parliamentary quirk. Life's too short for that drama. I'll keep my eye on the big picture, not the daily gossip.

The politicians talk about reforms and growth, but when I get on the bus that's always too full or the water pressure drops in my building, it doesn't feel like they're really listening to us. I vote, of course, but most of the time I'm just trying to make it through the day without worrying about the next electricity bill.

I've always been grateful for Uruguay's stability – we've had peaceful transitions of power for decades, and our social programs like healthcare and pensions have been reliable. Politics to me isn't about the shouting on TV or the endless debates on social media. It's about whether my pension will cover my needs when I retire, if my niece's university grant will still be available, and if the healthcare system will function when my mother needs it. I pay my taxes, vote when I feel there's a clear choice (which isn't often), and trust that the institutions work because they've always done so. I'm busy with my job, my nieces, and making sure my garden has enough flowers for the summer – politics is just something that happens in the background, not something I actively follow or worry about.

I read El País every morning and discuss these things with my book club, but I'm not chasing political rallies or scrolling through angry posts on social media like the young people.

Vivo en un país con una democracia estable desde hace décadas, donde los partidos políticos suelen moverse dentro de un marco social de consenso, no como en otros países más polarizados. Me interesan las políticas que afectan directamente a mi vida: educación pública (porque soy profesora universitaria), salud y seguridad ciudadana, pero no me consume ni las elecciones ni los debates diarios en redes sociales. Prefiero enfocarme en mi trabajo y mi familia, aunque sigo leyendo periódicos y escuchando las noticias principales. No soy una activista política, pero tampoco soy indiferente; es más como una preocupación práctica, no emocional. En los últimos años, con los cambios económicos, he notado que la política afecta más mis ahorros, pero aún así, no la sigo con la misma intensidad que cuando era más joven. El partido Colorado y el Blanco siguen teniendo influencia aquí en Montevideo, pero no me siento identificada con ninguna causa extrema.

Last week the boss said we might have to take a pay cut to cover the new software. Politics? Yeah, I hear about it on the radio while I'm commuting, but those politicians all talk like they live in another country. They don't know what it's like to calculate every peso for groceries, or when the bus breaks down. I voted once in my life, but nothing ever changed for people like me. My wife says I should care more about the president's speeches, but when I'm fixing dinner and helping the kids with homework, I just want the system to stop punishing us. I'm tired of hearing promises about \"a better future\" that never show up in my bank account.",

My son's got a job in the city, and he's always talking about \"political change,\" but I tell him, \"Son, you fix your own car, you don't need politics to get it running.\" We got enough to do with keeping food on the table without wasting time on talk that goes nowhere.

I've seen politicians say they'll fix things but then nothing changes for workers like me. I'm just focused on my job and keeping my head above water, so why waste time thinking about it? It's not that I don't care, but it feels pointless.",

Every time I see those politicians on TV, they're all talking about things I don't understand, like \"fiscal policy\" or \"regional integration.\" They sit in nice offices with big chairs while we're here counting pennies to put food on the table. Last time there was an election, I heard people arguing about who was \"better,\" but honestly? It's all the same. They make promises to rich folks on the radio, then nothing changes for us. My boss at the cafe says the \"government should fix things\" but he's always complaining about his taxes. What's the point of thinking about it? If I cared more, would my rent go down? Would my son get a scholarship? No. So why waste time on it? My job's hard enough without adding politics to my head. It's not that I don't care about Uruguay - I want a country where we can live without worrying about bread every day - but politics feels like shouting into a windstorm.

My grandson says he wants to be a lawyer, but I tell him to just learn a trade like I did—something real, not sitting in some big office arguing. I got my two children fed, raised them right, and that's what matters. What do I care about who's in power when I'm trying to save enough for my hip to not hurt so bad? I've seen governments come and go, and the only thing that changes is the price of things. Nah, politics doesn't help old ladies like me. It's a waste of time.",

Now at 76, I've learned that getting involved in the constant partisan squabbles only leads to frustration – the same arguments about state control or market freedom that have divided us for decades. I've built a good life for my family, contributed to community projects through my professional network, and I focus on what I can influence: my garden, my grandchildren's education, and our quiet neighborhood meetings. Politics feels like a noisy, exhausting spectacle now – one that rarely changes the slow, steady work of making a society function.

The politicians have their roles; I have my garden, my grandchildren visiting, my pension that keeps up with the cost of living here in Uruguay. I'll read the paper and understand the main points of the election or the big bill debated, but it doesn't consume my days like it might for a younger man with more to fight for. I trust the system – well, the basic system – has worked enough to give me security. It's not that I don't care, but it's not the fire I might have felt younger.

Me preocupa más la gente de mi barrio, si van a poder pagar el alquiler, si los médicos están bien.

I get up at 6am to clean the big house in La Barra for the señora who owns the shop downtown, then come home to my two kids. I see the politicians on TV making promises they never keep, like when they said they'd fix the bus service. But what do I get? Same old broken buses. My husband works in the garage, we just want enough to pay for the kids' school shoes and maybe a little something for the Sunday lunch with family. Politics is for those people who sit in offices and argue all day, not for me and my neighbors trying to get by. It's like listening to someone speak a language I don't understand – it feels too far away, too confusing, and honestly, it doesn't change the fact I have to scrub the kitchen floor again tomorrow.

The last government promised better jobs, but the only thing that changed was the price of bread. I tried voting once when I was younger, but what did it do? Same politicians came back, same empty promises. My boss at work says the mayor is \"working on the neighborhood,\" but the potholes in our street are still there after three years. Why should I care? I'm not going to get rich from politics, and it doesn't help me put food on the table. Besides, I'm not stupid—I know they're all the same, just looking for their own gain.

I vote, of course, but I'm tired of the empty promises and media frenzy around every election.

The young people today seem so angry, so certain; I've learned that good governance requires patience and compromise, not passion.

It's not that I hate politics, it's just... it feels like it's happening in another world. I've seen enough broken promises to know it won't change anything for me or my family. So asking if I'm \"interested\" is like asking if I'd enjoy watching paint dry.",

Me preocupa si hoy tengo dinero para el alquiler, si mi hijo puede seguir estudiando, si el transporte público no se haya vuelto más caro. ¿Para qué me va a interesar lo que dicen en el parlamento si nadie les escucha? Ya viste que siempre son los mismos, todos prometen y después no cumplen. Mejor me quedo con mis asuntos, que son reales, no con esas palabras que suenan bonito pero no dan de comer.

La política me parece un asunto de jóvenes y gente que tiene tiempo, no de una trabajadora que se levanta a las 5 para llegar a tiempo al trabajo y después atender a mi nieto. En Uruguay, ya vimos de todo: gobiernos que prometieron, otros que prometieron más, y al final siempre es lo mismo, los precios suben y los sueldos no. Mi preocupación es qué va a ser del plan de pensiones, si el médico del barrio va a seguir atendiendo a los adultos mayores, no a qué partido va a ganar las elecciones. La gente de mi edad no discute política en el barrio, hablamos de cómo pagar el gas, de si el transporte colectivo ya está en hora, no de leyes. Me gusta escuchar el tango por la radio, no los discursos de los políticos. No me interesa, no porque sea estúpida, sino porque mi vida está acá, en el presente, no en las discusiones vacías de los salones de poder.",
