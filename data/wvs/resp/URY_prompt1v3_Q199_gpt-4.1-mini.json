As an 18-year-old with a higher education background and from an upper middle class family, I have a certain privilege and responsibility to understand the political landscape because policies influence opportunities and rights. I respect fairness and social justice, but I also see the complexity of balancing economic growth and social needs. I do pay attention to national political debates, especially because I want to participate actively when I become eligible to vote. However, I don’t obsess over day-to-day political news or controversies. I feel somewhat detached from the aggressive back-and-forth in media but still care about the direction the country takes. So I’d say I have a moderate interest grounded in wanting to be informed and engaged without it being a dominating passion.",

I don't have the time or energy to follow everything very closely, but I do pay attention when something big happens, like elections or when there are talks about wages, social services, or health care. I believe it’s important to know what politicians are doing because sometimes it decides whether my salary can stretch enough or if services improve. Also, I tend to trust people who come from the working class or unions more than those who are just wealthy and distant from regular life. So I am interested, but I don't study every detail.

While I don't follow every debate or political scandal in exhaustive detail, I do keep up with the major issues and government actions that can influence the clerical work environment and social policies. I am aware of how important it is to be informed, and though I may not be as passionately engaged as someone who lives and breathes politics, I don't find it dull or irrelevant.

I don’t spend hours watching the news or debating political ideas because I have bills to pay and a family to take care of. Still, I listen when people talk about changes, especially when they say it might affect jobs or taxes. I want things to improve, but I’m a bit skeptical about politicians—they often promise things and then nothing changes.

He visto muchos políticos prometiendo cosas que nunca cumplen, y aunque me preocupe lo que pase en el país, muchas veces siento que no me escuchan ni a mí ni a los de mi barrio. Trabajo desde hace años con gente común, y la mayoría estamos más preocupados en llegar a fin de mes y cuidar a los nietos que en andar peleando con asuntos que parecen lejanos o complicados. No digo que no me importe, pero a veces me descorazona y me da como poca esperanza. Entonces, cuando me preguntan qué tan interesada estoy, creo que es más un interés con cuidado y distancia para no sufrir, no un interés fuerte. Me gusta saber un poco, pero no me meto mucho, porque ya no me da el cuero ni la paciencia.",

Me preocupo por lo que pasa en el barrio, el preço de las cosas y la salud, pero la política es como algo lejano, complicado, y muchas veces siento que nos toman el pelo. A veces escucho la radio o veo la televisión porque me quiero enterar, pero no puedo decir que me guste mucho, ni que me emocione. Me parece que hay peores problemas que la política misma, y con mi edad prefiero dedicarme a lo mío y a la familia.

Trabajo todos los días y no me sobra tiempo para ponerme a investigar o seguir las noticias con detalle. Me interesa que haya mejores condiciones de trabajo y que la cosa mejore para la gente que vive como yo, pero parece que lo que dicen en la tele o en las radios es solo para los políticos o para los que tienen plata. A veces me molesta que los políticos no cumplen lo que prometen, y uno se cansa de escuchar lo mismo siempre. Por eso, no me considero muy interesada en política, ni la sigo de cerca, aunque sé que es importante para el país.",

I work as a clerical worker, which means I’m concerned about job stability, pensions, healthcare, and basic public services. I don’t follow every little news headline, but I pay attention during election times, and when the government makes changes that affect my daily life. Sometimes politics feels distant and complicated, but when it touches our pocket or my family, that’s when I really notice it. I vote, because I believe it’s important, and I think our country benefits from honesty and fairness – values that resonate with the older generation I’m part of. So, I wouldn’t say I’m very interested, in the sense of always reading or debating politics, but I do care enough to follow what affects me and those around me.",

I tend to approach politics pragmatically, looking for policies that promote social welfare balanced with economic responsibility.

I worked hard all my life and value the stability that good policies can bring. I believe politics is important because it impacts education, healthcare, and social security—things that matter to families and workers. Although I am not always caught up with the latest political scandals or debates, I remain informed about the big decisions and elections because they influence the future of the country and the quality of life for everyday people. I don’t get overly involved or passionate, but I keep an eye on politics because it is relevant to me, my colleagues, and my children.",
