It’s a waste of time. I believe in a stable society, one built on hard work and responsibility. The Partido Nacional, with its focus on fiscal prudence and a strong economy, aligns more with my values.

I worry about the economy, naturally – keeping things stable for my son, Daniel, and his future. That's what really matters. The politicians... they seem more concerned with their own power than with the well-being of the people. I suppose a little awareness is good, to be a responsible citizen, but I don’t want to get bogged down in the details. It’s exhausting. I’d rather focus on things I *can* control – my family, my home, my investments. This country needs strong leadership, someone who understands business, someone pragmatic.

I respect the principle of a functioning democracy, of course. One needs to ensure the country is… stable. But I don’t follow every detail. My time is better spent with my family, managing my investments, ensuring the estate is properly looked after. There are serious matters being discussed – inflation, the upcoming elections – and naturally, I have opinions. But getting bogged down in the minutiae of party politics? No. It’s far too messy. I lean towards a conservative viewpoint, naturally. A strong economy and a respect for tradition are paramount. I believe in a stable, prosperous Uruguay, and I trust that those with the experience and the right values will guide the country. Frankly, I'm more concerned with the practical consequences of government policy – will it affect my returns? Will it impact the value of my property? – than the philosophical arguments being made in the press. I suppose, on balance, I’d say *somewhat interested*. It's a civic duty, you understand.",

It feels… wasteful. There’s a lot of division these days, and frankly, I find it unsettling. I believe in order, in respect for tradition, and in a government that keeps things running smoothly. I follow the news, of course, to see what’s happening, but I don’t get caught up in all the shouting. It’s important to be informed, certainly, but getting personally involved? No. It's a young man's game, and I’ve earned my peace. I trust the people who know how to handle things – the professionals. This country, Uruguay, is built on pragmatism, not idealistic notions.

Education is important, the economy… that’s where my concern lies. I volunteer with the local school’s fundraising committee, you know, ensuring our children have decent opportunities. I believe in responsible governance, certainly. Someone needs to be looking out for the stability of the country, and the wellbeing of citizens, especially those who are… less fortunate. But getting bogged down in the day-to-day squabbles, the shouting… it seems so unproductive. The Partido Nacional is generally sensible, pragmatic. I think it's important to support a party that understands the value of hard work and a stable currency. It's just...so draining. I suppose a small degree of interest is necessary, but I prefer to direct my energy toward things I *can* influence.",

There’s a lot of concern about the economy, naturally, and the rising cost of everything, and that’s something I genuinely care about, because it affects my pension, and the security of my family. But the grand, ideological battles… they seem so distant from everyday life. I prefer to focus on what's practical, what can be actually *fixed*.

I think it’s vital to support the kind of policies that encourage investment and growth.  I suppose a basic understanding is necessary, but I don’t have time for endless debates.

It’s not about being *interested* in the day-to-day squabbles, it's about stability. A nation needs leadership, and frankly, the opposition seems more concerned with virtue signalling than with actual progress.

I spent my life meticulously managing the accounts for a textile company – precision, order, knowing where every peso was going. Politics is just… chaos. It’s the young people, really, always shouting and demanding things. I believe in a sensible, steady hand. The government should be focused on practical matters – ensuring businesses can thrive, keeping inflation down, maybe a little investment in infrastructure. It’s not about grand ideologies or passionate speeches. It's about responsible management. I read the *El País*, of course, to keep abreast of things, but I don't get drawn into the debates. It seems so… unproductive. I’ve seen enough in my time to know that good intentions often lead to disastrous outcomes. I prefer to stick to my garden and my grandchildren.

I prefer to trust the experts, the economists, and the people who seem to have a handle on things. It’s a bit overwhelming, really. I’m comfortable with the status quo, to be frank.
