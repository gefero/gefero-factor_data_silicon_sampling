It's hard to know what's true and who is really looking out for our interests. Sometimes it feels like they're all talking past each other rather than listening to the people who need help most.

As someone with higher education and a stable career, I feel it's essential to stay informed about current events and local politics. However, my busy schedule often leaves me little time for in-depth analysis or involvement in party activities. Still, I believe it's crucial to have an opinion on issues that affect our country, such as education, healthcare, and economic development.\n\nI tend to trust established sources like newspaper articles and news broadcasts when making sense of complex political situations. While I'm not a fan of extremes or radical ideologies, I do think it's vital for Uruguay to maintain its social democratic values and protect individual freedoms. In short, I'd say my interest in politics is mostly about staying informed enough to make decisions about how to vote.",

My son is a bit more into that sort of thing, he's always talking about the economy and whatnot. But for me, it's just a necessity, you know? I need to make ends meet, put food on the table for my family. That's what keeps me up at night.\n\nI do think about the state of our country, though. The peso is devaluing again, and it's getting harder to afford the things we need. And don't even get me started on the healthcare system - it's a joke. But even with all that, I just don't see myself as someone who's going to be \"in the know\" or care about some politician's speeches.",

Politics is often seen as something distant, but for me, it's all about who can help make sure these basic needs are met. Sometimes, when politicians talk about economic policies or social services, it sparks my interest because I think about how it could impact our community.\n\nOn the other hand, politics can be frustrating and feel like a big mess. Corruption, inequality, and the lack of opportunities for many people in this country make me question whether anyone is truly listening to us. Some politicians just seem out of touch with reality. But despite all this, I do try to stay informed about issues that matter to me and my family.\n\nI guess what it comes down to is that politics is not really something I enjoy doing for its own sake, but when it affects the things that are important to me, then I become more engaged.",

However, I do feel the need to stay informed about issues that affect our country's economy and infrastructure. As someone who works in the private sector, I have a vested interest in seeing policies that promote stability and growth.\n\nI've always been critical of politicians who prioritize party agendas over practical solutions. But at the same time, I understand the importance of having a representative voice for our country. The problem is that most politicians seem more interested in lining their own pockets than doing what's best for Uruguay.\n\nDespite this cynicism, I still believe it's essential to participate in the democratic process, even if I don't feel very engaged. My husband is more into politics than I am, and he always encourages me to stay informed. Maybe that's why I find myself somewhat interested in following current events – not because I'm passionate about politics, but because I want to support my family and our way of life.",

I reckon that's what the left party does - they're always talking about helping the working class and fighting against inequality.\n\nI've got a few friends who are really into politics, but even they don't get too worked up about it most of the time. They just kinda go through the motions, you know? Vote, complain on social media, repeat. I mean, I guess it's better than not paying attention at all, but...\n\nStill, I do think about the issues sometimes - like how the government's been increasing prices on food and gas, affecting our low wages even more.
