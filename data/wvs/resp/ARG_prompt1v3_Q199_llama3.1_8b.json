They're always arguing about something or other.\n\nI do think it's nice when a politician does something good for us, like fixing the road outside our neighborhood or building more hospitals. But then again, they also raise our taxes and that's hard on a working-class person like me. I just try to focus on my own family and community, you know? We have enough trouble making ends meet without getting too involved in what the politicians are doing.\n\nI used to care more about politics when my son was growing up, but now he's married with kids of his own and they're all grown up too. I've got grandkids who are in school now and it's hard for me to keep track of everything that's going on. Politics seems like a waste of time when there's so much other important work to be done.\n\nI do try to listen when the news is on TV, but it just seems like they're always arguing about the same thing. And then there are all the scandals and corruption... It's hard to keep track of who's doing what wrong. I think we should focus more on our own community and less on the politicians.",
