My father used to say, “A good man keeps his head down and works hard.” That’s what I’ve always done. I manage the paperwork for the *puesto de control*, you know? It’s steady work, pays the bills. I don't have time for all this… fuss. The government, the politicians… they’re always messing things up. Inflation is bad enough without them adding to it. I try to stay out of it, really. It’s a messy business, and I just want things to be… stable. My concern is for my family, for my son’s future. That’s where my energy should be focused. Honestly, I’d rather be tending to my rose bushes. It’s a serious matter, but I don’t think I’m qualified to offer a strong opinion. It’s all so complicated.",

I’ve seen enough trouble come from meddling. The government… they’re supposed to look after us, of course, make sure things are running smoothly for honest folks like myself. But it feels like they’re always making things worse, adding more taxes, more regulations. I try to stay out of it, you know? It’s best not to get caught up in all that. I support the President, he seems like a decent man, trying to do his job. But honestly, I don't spend my time worrying about it. It’s a worry for younger folks, maybe. I’ve got a trade to keep, a family to look after, and a pension to worry about.",

I vote, of course, for the sensible people, the ones who talk about growth and stability. But getting deeply involved? Too much noise. Too much negativity. It’s exhausting. I trust the professionals, the engineers and architects, to handle the big decisions. I have my opinions, certainly, but I keep them to myself mostly. It’s just… draining.",

The Peronists always seem to be causing trouble, and the right wing… well, they can be a bit extreme. It’s best to let the professionals handle it, isn’t it? The economists, the lawyers… they understand the nuances. I trust their judgment more than the opinions of the average person. It's important to have a functioning country, and that requires a certain level of competence, doesn’t it? I’m not saying I *don't* care, but I have more important things to worry about – my family, my business, ensuring a good future for my son, Mateo. Politics seems… distant, frankly.",

The rich people, the politicians… they just seem to be playing games, and it doesn’t really affect me. I care about getting a good university degree, maybe something in business, you know? That’s what matters. I’m not someone who wants to spend my time worrying about what the government is doing. It’s just… tiring. Plus, honestly, I don't understand half of what they talk about. It’s always about numbers and things I don't really grasp. It feels… distant. I trust the people I know and respect – my family, my professors. They seem to have a better handle on things.

I don’t really understand all the fancy words, and it makes my head hurt. The politicians… they just seem to promise things and never deliver. I mostly worry about getting enough money for the month, making sure my mamá has medicine, that's what really matters. I don’t have time for all that debate and disagreement. It’s… exhausting. I try to keep my head down and just get by, you know? It’s not my problem. Honestly, I just want things to be stable, to be predictable. Politics... it’s always changing, and I don’t like change.",

I voted for Macri last time, thought he was trying to do something, but… well, he didn't. It’s all so complicated. I work hard, trying to provide for my family, and I don't have time for arguing about ideologies. It’s important to be informed, of course, but frankly, it’s exhausting. I care about things that affect me – a good price on beef, a stable peso – and that's where my energy goes. Politics… it feels distant, like something happening to other people.

I try to keep my head down, focus on my work, provide for my family. My papá always said, \"Don’t get involved in the fights of others.\" And he was right, mostly. I believe in hard work, in responsibility, in looking after your own. The government… well, they’re supposed to be here to help, but they seem to create more problems than they solve. I’m not stupid, I see what’s happening with the inflation, with the cost of everything going up. It’s frustrating, makes you want to do something, but… it’s all so complicated. I trust the people who build things, the engineers, the technicians – that’s where real solutions come from. So, I’ll say… not very interested. It’s a waste of time, generally.",
