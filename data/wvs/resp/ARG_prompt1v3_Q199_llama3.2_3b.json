Like, I remember last year there was a big protest in the city against the increase in bus fares. A lot of people were upset, and some even got violent. That made me wonder what could be done to make sure everyone has access to basic services like healthcare and education.\n\nOn the other hand, politics doesn't really affect my daily life that much. I work at a store, and my boss tells me what to do, not some politician. And when it comes to making ends meet, it's more about finding ways to save money and make some extra cash on the side than worrying about who's in power.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, politics isn't something that's at the forefront of my mind all the time, but if someone asked me how interested I was, I'd probably say I'm somewhat interested. Not because I think it's super important or anything, but because I do care about some things, like education and healthcare.",

But at the same time, I don't really understand most of it. All those fancy words and numbers... I just want to work hard and provide for my family. That's what matters.\n\nI do follow some news, mainly about local issues like infrastructure development or labor rights. My union is always telling me about new laws that might affect our contracts. But when it comes to national politics... it's all just noise to me. I trust the people who run my trade unions more than anyone in politics.

I've got more important things to think about, like how I'm going to pay the bills this month or fix my old car. But I know it's something that affects us all, you know? The government and its policies can impact our daily lives, from the prices of goods to the quality of our healthcare. Sometimes I feel like politicians are just looking out for themselves, rather than for the people they're supposed to be representing. That's frustrating. Still, I don't really have the time or energy to get involved in politics. I've got a family to provide for and a life to lead.",

The government is just there to make rules and take our money, you know? I don't really care about the parties or the politicians, as long as they keep the economy going and the price of meat affordable.\n\nI remember when Perón was president, things were better. We had jobs, and everyone had a place to live. Since then, it's just been one problem after another. The economy is struggling, and people are getting poorer. I'm not really optimistic about any politician fixing that anytime soon.\n\nI mean, I vote because my wife tells me to, but I don't really think it makes a difference either way.
