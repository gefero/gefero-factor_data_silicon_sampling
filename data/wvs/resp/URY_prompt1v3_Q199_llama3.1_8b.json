Politics is just a bunch of noise on the radio or TV that doesn't make sense most of the time. What good does it do me, right? My abuelo used to say that you can't change the government, but you can vote for the guy who's not as bad as the other one. But I don't even bother voting. It's all just a mess. The politicians are corrupt and only care about themselves. We need more jobs and lower prices on food, but they're always talking about things that don't affect me.",

However, I must admit that sometimes politics can be quite polarizing and exhausting, especially with the 24-hour news cycle. But I try to maintain a level-headed approach, focusing on the issues that directly affect me and my community. My education has instilled in me the importance of civic engagement and participation in shaping our democracy. I regularly follow local and international news sources to stay up-to-date, and I've even participated in some local protests and initiatives in the past.\n\nI'd say being interested in politics is crucial for building a better future for Uruguay, but it can also be overwhelming at times.

Still, I've been disappointed by some recent decisions from our government, and it's made me feel less inclined to follow politics closely.

And besides, we're Uruguayans - we have our problems, but at least we live in a country that values equality and social justice.

We've had plenty of leaders come and go, and nothing changes. Still, my wife gets worked up about every election, saying we need to make our voices heard. I just don't see it doing any good.",
