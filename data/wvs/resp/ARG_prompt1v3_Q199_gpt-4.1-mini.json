On the other hand, I realize politics affects everyone in the country and can impact things like our education, economy, and the safety of our neighborhoods. Still, I mostly stay informed through social media or chats with friends and family, rather than actively following political news or debates.

Things like inflation, taxes, and job security matter to me and my family. Though I’m not someone who follows every detail or debates about politicians all day, I make sure to know enough to decide when elections come around and to understand how government decisions might influence prices or my income. I don’t trust politicians too much because many times it seems they’re working for their own interests, but I still pay attention because it impacts my future. So, I wouldn’t say I’m very interested like some people who study politics, but I stay somewhat informed since it’s necessary.",

I watch the news now and then, mostly to know if there's gonna be any strikes, if my job could be affected, or if the government plans to increase taxes or prices. I care that they don’t forget about us, the workers, but I don’t spend a lot of time following politics closely because life is already busy and hard.

But at the same time, the politics I see on TV or hear about often feels complicated and distant—sometimes like it’s all just promises and nobody delivers. I don’t get too deep into all the ideological stuff; I mostly care about what policies mean for day-to-day life and the economy. I follow the news enough to understand what’s going on because ignorance doesn’t help, but I’m not one of those people who spends hours debating. I get frustrated with corruption and the political chaos we have, but I stay informed enough to vote and to have an opinion on who might manage things better.

No tuve trabajo nunca y aunque sí me preocupo por lo que pasa en mi barrio y con los servicios que recibimos, muchas veces siento que los políticos no entienden nuestra realidad o sólo piensan en ellos mismos. Por eso, a veces miro las noticias o escucho lo que dicen, pero no sigo mucho los detalles ni los debates complejos porque parece que todo es un lío y no cambia mucho para nosotros. Me interesa lo que afecta lo cotidiano, como los precios, la educación de los chicos, la salud, pero eso no me hace estar pegada a la política todo el tiempo. Prefiero dedicar mi tiempo a la familia y las cosas del día a día, aunque sé que debería entenderlo más para votar mejor o exigir mis derechos. En resumen, tengo un interés, pero no es algo que me apasione ni que me haga seguir la política muy de cerca.",

But honestly, a lot of the time it feels like politics is just people talking and nothing changing for us in the neighborhood. I try to keep up with the news and politics enough to know what’s going on because I’m worried about how the economy is going. Jobs can be uncertain, inflation worries everyone, and I want to know which party might help us get through tough times. But sometimes it also feels kind of frustrating, like the politicians don’t really listen to people like me, the working class guys trying to do right by our families. So, I’m interested enough to follow along, especially during elections or big changes, but I don’t obsess about politics every single day.",

No es que siga cada debate o programa político, pero sí me fijo en las noticias y escucho lo que dicen en el barrio. Por eso, no diría que soy muy interesada, pero no puedo decir que no me importa.

My higher education helps me grasp the complexities, yet I remain grounded — I don’t get caught up in slogans or ideologies. I try to separate what’s useful from the noise. I care about stability and fairness, even if the system rarely rewards those who work hard but don’t have special connections or wealth.

At the same time, I feel somewhat skeptical because politicians often promise changes that don’t materialize, or there is a lot of political instability that wears people down. I don't spend all my time debating politics, but I try to stay informed enough to understand where things might be heading. So, I would say I have an interest; it’s not just casual, but it’s practical and grounded in the need to protect my livelihood and make some sense of what’s happening around me. Still, I wouldn’t say I’m very passionate or completely immersed in it like activists or party members might be.",

Working in a semi-skilled job, I see how government decisions influence wages, job stability, and prices in the market. I don't have a university degree, but I’ve learned enough to understand that politics isn’t just about who’s in power, but about how policies hit us in the pocket and the quality of public services like healthcare and education. I don’t get too involved in complicated debates or follow every detail, but when elections come close, I pay attention, listen to conversations with neighbors and coworkers, and try to make an informed decision. I’m worried about corruption and whether politicians really care about people like me, not just the wealthy or big businesses. So yes, I’d say I’m interested enough to keep informed and vote, because it matters for my family and future.",

Being 20 and never having had a real job yet, I see a lot of promises from politicians but not much change for people like me. I grew up hearing my family talk about politics mostly in a negative way — corruption, broken promises, the rich getting richer. My secondary education gave me some basic understanding, but I’ve never felt like politics really speaks to people like me in the lower middle class. At the same time, I do care about things like jobs and social programs, because I know those affect how people around me live. But the constant fights and scandals make me want to stay a bit away from all that. So, while I’m not completely unaware or indifferent, I don’t spend much time following politics and don’t feel a strong connection to it.",

I know it affects many things in my daily life—the prices, jobs, and security—but I often feel like politicians don’t really hear people like me. I try to keep an eye on what’s happening, especially when there are big elections or stories about inflation and work. Still, it’s hard to stay fully engaged because I don’t always understand all the details, and sometimes it just feels like promises that don’t get fulfilled. So I’m interested enough to pay attention when it matters but not someone who follows every debate or political news closely.",

Politics always affect us workers directly—things like inflation, pensions, and job stability. I don’t follow every debate or every law, but I do pay attention when it hits my pocket or when they talk about workers' rights, health services, or security. Sometimes it feels like the politicians make promises they never keep, and that makes me a bit weary. Still, I care enough about how the country is run because it shapes the everyday life for me and my family.

A veces siento que los políticos están muy lejos de nosotros, que hacen muchas promesas que después no cumplen, y eso me genera desconfianza. Pero igual, cada tanto veo las noticias o escucho lo que se dice, porque quiero entender un poco cómo van a manejar las cosas que afectan mi economía y el futuro de mis hijos. No me meto mucho a discutir, pero sí me gusta estar al tanto, aunque sea de manera general, para no estar completamente afuera. Por eso, diría que me interesa la política, pero sin ser una persona que vive de eso o que lo sigue obsesivamente.",

A veces siento que no cambian nada para el trabajador, que están todos peleando y no arreglan los problemas de la calle ni los sueldos. Pero a la vez, uno le presta atención cuando se habla de cosas que afectan a la gente común, como la inflación o los aumentos. No es que me guste mucho ni que me la pase pensando en eso, pero tampoco es que me da lo mismo del todo. Creo que es importante saber un poco para no quedar totalmente afuera, aunque me cuesta.

I value stability and security because I want to provide for my family and see a better future for my children. But on the other hand, politics can sometimes feel distant, full of promises that don’t materialize, corruption, and endless bickering that don’t improve my life directly. I don't follow every detail or party infighting, but I stay informed enough to understand what the government is doing since taxes, work laws, and social issues impact me. I prefer practical issues over ideological debates. So I can't say I am very interested, but I do pay attention and try to understand key decisions and elections as they can change my prospects.",
